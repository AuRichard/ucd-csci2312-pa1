This project is suppose to gather in the points of a triangle of three dimensions.
Then after gather the lengths of the each side of the triangle to find the area.
That is accomplish by using Heron's formula and outputting how many test the code has passed.

1) Area.cpp
2) ErrorContext.cpp
3) ErrorContext.h
4) main.cpp

6) Point.h
7) PointTests.cpp
8)PointsTests.h

Txt and md files:
1) CMakeLists.txt
2) makefile
